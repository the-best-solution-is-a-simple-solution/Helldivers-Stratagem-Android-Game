This was a fun little Java game made for Android devices in the COSC 195 Mobile Programming class in the first year.
It is based off of the Hell Divers 2, Stratagem Heros game in the space shuttle.
Simply clone the repo and build it as an apk in Android Studio, then copy to your phone and install.
Should work on most devices around the 6.2-6.7" screen diameter.
